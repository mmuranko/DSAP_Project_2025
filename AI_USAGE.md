# Monte Carlo Portfolio Reconstruction

---

## AI Usage

### Overview

The project's architecture, financial logic, and research methodology were developed independently. Artificial Intelligence tools (Google Gemini and OpenAI ChatGPT) were used to assist with specific coding tasks, such as helping to implement more advanced functions, debugging errors, and improving code structure.

### Usage Summary

AI tools were used for the following purposes:

* **Implementation Assistance:** Used for specific logic within the `MonteCarloEngine` class and the CLI menu structure in `main.py`. Additionally, they generated regular expressions for the parsing strategy in the `src\data_loader.py` module.
* **Optimisation:** Helped with the implementation of vectorised operations, instead of iterative loops, within the `src\data_processor.py` module.
* **Debugging:** Troubleshot errors and resolved library dependency conflicts.
* **Documentation:** Drafted industry standard docstrings, comments, and type hints.

### Verification Statement

I certify that I have reviewed and tested all code included in this project. I understand the logic and functionality of every module. The core concepts and analytical conclusions are entirely my own work.
