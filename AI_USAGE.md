# AI Tools Usage Declaration

## Overview
This document outlines the usage of Artificial Intelligence tools (Google Gemini and ChatGPT) in the development of the **Portfolio Reconstruction & Monte Carlo Engine**.

The conceptual framework, research questions, and financial logic are 100% my own work. The codebase is primarily my work, with AI serving as a technical assistant for specific implementation details, optimization, and troubleshooting.

## Usage Summary

* **Implementation Assistance:** AI assisted with the specific implementation details of the `MonteCarloEngine` class and the "Intelligent Dependency Chaining" logic within the `main.py` menu system.
* **Optimization:** I used AI to identify vectorization strategies for `data_processor.py` to improve performance.
* **Debugging:** AI tools were used to troubleshoot runtime errors and resolve library conflicts.
* **Documentation:** AI assisted in drafting docstrings and formatting documentation files.

## Verification Statement
I certify that:

1.  I have reviewed and tested all code included in this project.
2.  I fully understand the logic and functionality of every module.
3.  The core concepts and analytical conclusions are entirely my own work.
